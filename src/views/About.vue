      <h2><b>What is "My To-do"?</b></h2>
      <p>"My To-do" is a todo list app that allows you to add your chores to improve your tasks, organize yourself better and meet your daily goals</p>
      <h2><b>Why us?</b></h2>
      <p>To-do lists don't need to be complicated. Plenty of people use a pen and paper for the job without any problem, but for some people it is not that easy. So a new to-do list app seems to come out every day. Why? Because keeping track of your tasks is an intensely personal thing, and people will reject anything that doesn't feel right pretty much instantly. That makes it hard to find the right app. That's why we are here, if some applications are very difficult to use or you lose your pencil and paper and where you wrote down your tasks, we will help you organize in a simple and fast way.</p>
      <h2><b>What makes us a great to-do list app?</b></h2>
      <p>When it comes to to-do lists, everyone has different criteria. We kept this in mind for people who needs and want something easy and fast, so that is what we are, an app to make it fast to add and organize tasks</p>
